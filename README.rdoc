Just a simple, mobile ready, single page Rails app for a job interview test.  Ideally I would have created this using meteor, and it would have been more mobile ready.

DEPLOYMENT ISSUES:
* Due to button being deprecated, the search function does not work YET on the Heroku app, although it does work when run locally.
* I noticed there are a few issues with the way it's displayed, due to mixin deprecations, such as gray background on product card images, search button out of place.  Bummer.

Try it on Heroku:
